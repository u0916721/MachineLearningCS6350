#This is the code for part B
#Based on your code of the decision tree learning algorithm (with infor-
#mation gain), implement a Bagged trees learning algorithm. Note that each tree
#should be fully expanded â€” no early stopping or post pruning. Vary the number
#of trees from 1 to 500, report how the training and test errors vary along with the
#tree number in a figure. Overall, are bagged trees better than a single tree? Are
#bagged trees better than Adaboost?
